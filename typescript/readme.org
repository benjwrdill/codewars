* Working with Typescript
  Before starting this, typescript, mocha, chai, and nodejs must be installed. Node's version here is 10.24.1, reflected in =./.tool-versions=. You can install it using =asdf= or any other way. Typescript's version is 4.4.4. You can use the instructions on the typescript website to install. You can do the same for mocha and chai. Better to install globally for now.
  1. =npm install=
  2. =mkdir= and =cd= to the exercise directory.
  3. Copy the example file at the =typescript= root to the directory: =cp ../tsconfig.json.example ./tsconfig.json=.
  4. =touch solution.ts && touch test.ts= to create the solution and test files necessary.
  5. =tsc= to compile the typescript files into the =dist= directory.
  6. =mocha dist= to run any tests in the =dist= directory.
